# üõ†Ô∏è LAStools Command Summary for Taal-LiDAR-Understory Project

This document contains the full set of LAStools commands used to process and prepare airborne LiDAR data for tile-based understory metric extraction in the Taal Volcano study area.

---

## 1. Merge Tiles  
Combine the original LAZ files into a single merged dataset.

```bash
lasmerge -i data\\tile1.laz data\\tile2.laz data\\tile3.laz data\\tile4.laz -o data\\merged_taal.laz
````

---

## 2. Tile the Merged Dataset into 100m √ó 100m Grids

Break the merged data into 100 m tiles with a 20 m buffer for edge continuity.

```bash
mkdir data\\tiles
lastile -i data\\merged_taal.laz -tile_size 100 -buffer 20 -o data\\tiles\\tile.laz
```

---

## 3. Classify Ground Points

Use the `-wilderness` setting for natural terrain to classify ground returns.

```bash
mkdir data\\ground_tiles
lasground -i data\\tiles\\*.laz -wilderness -odir data\\ground_tiles -olaz
```

---

## 4. Normalize Heights

Adjust point cloud elevation so that ground = 0 m (height above ground).

```bash
mkdir data\\normalized_tiles
lasheight -i data\\ground_tiles\\*.laz -replace_z -odir data\\normalized_tiles -olaz
```

---

Each of these commands was executed using LAStools in a Windows-based environment. The outputs‚Äînormalized `.laz` tiles‚Äîserved as input for all subsequent Python scripts that computed the LiDAR-derived metrics used in this study: voxel occupancy ratio, fractional cover, normalized cover, leaf area density (LAD), and canopy cover ratio.

```

Let me know if you‚Äôd like to add the Python command chain in the same style.
